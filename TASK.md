# Secure Information Storage REST API

### TASK

The API is down and our customer support team is receiving a storm of complaints, especially on Reddit. You're the only guy who can solve this problem. Here's what you have to do to fix the situation:

* First of all - make API work (also, fix tests);
* Add item update endpoint - it should update user's item;
* Make it secure - users are keeping important, sensitive information in our secure storage, so it all depends on you;
* Make it fast - API is getting millions of requests every day;
* Refactor to make the code neat and clean - this will keep your teammates happy; 
* Add more tests;
* Make sure to keep a simple documentation for endpoints. Updating README.md is more than enough;
* Don't make any changes to requests and responses, because there are already a lot of clients using API and we wouldn't want to ruin anything, right?
* Use git, so that we can see your progress
